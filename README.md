# Garvuino 

The Garvuino is a PCB board for creating music, sounds and chiptunes, either through programming, soundtracker or live recording (midi).

![](garvuino_pcb.png)

It works with an Arduino Nano and an Atmega8 chip.

## Manual 

You can find the manual [here](doc/garvuino_manual.md).

## Features 

### AY-3-8910 emulator 

On Atmega8 chip, driven by the Arduino nano, from the [AVR-AY project](http://avray.ru/)

 * It can replay Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Amstrad chiptunes from the sd card.
 * It might be possible to use it as a (very simple and dirty) AY synth. We just need to code the synth in the future.

### Sid emulator 

On Arduino, from the [sid emulator lib](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SID-emulator)

 * It can replay some sid files, from the arduino memory, which is limited (so tunes will be cut). We'd like to find a way to stream the tune from the sd card, it's probably possible.
 * It can be used as a Sid synth, driven by midi.

### 1-bit music 

From [various 1-bit engines](http://randomflux.info/1bit/viewforum.php?id=5) (on arduino)

 * It can play music from the arduino memory. 1-bit music don't need much memory so a whole song, even a complex one, can fit in the memory. It might be possible to stream data from SD if the 1-bit music engine chosen is the same for all the songs.
 * It should be possible to create a 1-bit synth in the future. Probably not an easy task.

### Mozzi synth 

 * [Mozzy synth](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi), can output fun FM sounds and many other effects.

## Atmega8 setup 

Get a "USBASP USB ISP Programmer & 10 Pin ISP interface Cable - AVR ATMEL ATMega".

Connect it according to this schematic for the atmega8:

![](atmega8/atmega8_burn_bb.png)

Basically it's:

| SD reader |Atmega|
|--------|-------|
|MISO |pin 18: PB4|
|MOSI |pin 17: PB3|
|RESET |pin 01: PC6|
|VCC |pin 20: AVCC||
|SCK |pin 19: PB5|
|GND |pin 22: GND|

Use a 16 Mhz crystal for example, on pin 09 (PB6) and pin 10 (PB7).

Once it's connected, you can program the atmega8 chip with this command-line:

    avrdude -p atmega8 -c USBasp -U flash:w:AY_Emul_244_2ch.hex -U eeprom:w:Conf_standard_24MHz_1_75Mhz.hex -U lfuse:w:0xCE:m -U hfuse:w:0xCF:m 

Please refer to [this folder](atmega8) for more info about setting up the atmega8 chip.

## PCB 

Please refer to [this folder](pcb) for the fritzing sources and gerber files.

## Breadboard 

It can also work without the PCB. Just use a breadboard and a few wires!

![](breadboard/garvuino_09g_breadboard_only_bb.jpg)

Please refer to [this folder](breadboard) for the fritzing sources and pdf version.

## Arduino sketches 

Get the sketches [in this folder](arduino_sketches/)

*(more infos to come later)*

You can find [some tunes for using with the AVR-AY setup in here](tunes/). The arduino sketch can read the RSF files from the SD (it can't read the YM or AY files directly). You can convert to RSF with the [AVR-AY Player](http://www.avray.ru/avr-ay-player/).

## Expansion board

The expansion board is a new board for using with the Garvuino or other projects.
Solder 5K or 10K potentiometers onto the board. You don't need to solder the switches, they are not used at the moment.

Connect the digital pin D3 to the audio out, under the L or R of the AY>L or AY>R pin.

And also connect the 2 right top pins and the 3 bottom pins to the A0 to A4 pins on the arduino, connect the + to 5V and the - to ground, and you'll be able to control the Auduino and Auduino midi sketches found there: https://github.com/farvardin/garvuino/tree/master/arduino_sketches/others
